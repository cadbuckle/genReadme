## Installation
* Latest LTS version of Node required (Available here: https://nodejs.org/en/)
* Installation of the third party module "inquirer" (Please use version 8.0.0)

## Usage
From the command line enter:
    node genReadMe.js <full pathname of folder to place README.md>

A series of prompt will be presented for completion. When they have all been completed, the README.md will be created in the specified folder.

For example: 
* "node genReadMe.js ."  would create the README.md in the current directory.
* "node genReadMe.js ./weatherApp" would create the README.md in a subdirectory called weatherApp.

NOTE: destination folders must already exist. If the folder already contains a README.md file, it will be overwritten.
